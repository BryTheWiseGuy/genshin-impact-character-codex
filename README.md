# Welcome to Genshin.Codex

Welcome to Genshin.Codex. This web application is a codex of all current Genshin Impact characters that includes images, talent information, showcase videos, and basic character information. All data and images sourced in this project came from the Genshin Impact game, as well as the official Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki [pip](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki).

## License

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
