# Welcome to Genshin.Codex

## Introduction

Welcome to Genshin.Codex. This React web application was created with create-react-app. The current functionality of the project is a codex of all current Genshin Impact characters that includes images, talent information, showcase videos, and basic character information. All data and images sourced in this project came from the Genshin Impact game, as well as the official Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki (https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki).

## Installation

Genshin.Codex has it's backend deployed on Render (https://genshin-codex.onrender.com) and the frontend has been deployed on Netlify (https://genshin-codex.netlify.app/). Viewing this project on Netlify should not require any additional installation. To view the source code for this project, please fork this repository and clone it to your GitHub using your personal SSH key. Users may need to run npm install for all dependencies to be functional.

### Note:

Because this project has been deployed on the free version of Render, it may take 10-15 seconds for the Render server to start up. Anyone viewing this project may need to refresh a couple of times in order for the website to fully populate.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
